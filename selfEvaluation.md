# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I would say I feel mildly ok about for statements. I am still very confused on how to use them to solve problems but I can write the syntax for a for loop no problem.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

VERY UNPRODUCTIVE STRUGGLE I struggle with every single assignment and need to use my small group to make any process. I hate it.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

Everything, I will have to self teach myself everything from the beginning.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

too many to list. I will use the internet and my small group.
